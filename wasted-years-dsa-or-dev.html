    <h1>Wasted 2–3 Years of College: What to Do DSA or Dev?</h1>

    <p>First of all — stop panicking. Many students realize late that they’ve wasted their early college years, and that’s completely okay. The only thing that matters now is what you do next.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <strong>Rule #1:</strong> Pick something and stick to it. Don’t waste another month “researching what to do.” You already know your interests better than anyone else.
    </div>

    <p>If you’re confused between <strong>DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)</strong> and <strong>Development</strong>, here’s a practical guide to help you make a decision and get placed fast.</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Start With Basic DSA (Non-Negotiable)</h2>
    <p>DSA is a must. Even if you plan to go into development, you can’t escape DSA completely. It builds your problem-solving foundation.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Start solving questions on <a href="https://leetcode.com" target="_blank">LeetCode</a>.</li>
      <li>Target at least <strong>300 problems</strong> — roughly 3 months of consistent effort.</li>
      <li>If you’re short on time, follow <a href="https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/" target="_blank">InterviewBit’s problem set</a> (~270 curated questions).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Focus on understanding patterns — arrays, strings, linked lists, stacks, queues, recursion, trees, and graphs. These are asked everywhere.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Choose Based on Your College Placement Scenario</h2>
    <p>If your college offers good <strong>on-campus opportunities</strong>, double down on DSA. Most top companies (Amazon, Microsoft, etc.) will test your coding and logic more than projects.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <strong>Goal:</strong> Be able to solve at least LeetCode Medium questions on your own without hints.
    </div>

    <p>On the other hand, if your college doesn’t have strong placements, then pure DSA may not be enough. In that case, focus on <strong>Development + Freelance/Startup Experience</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Pick Development if You Need Proof of Work</h2>
    <p>Development helps you show real skills and build things people can use. You can land jobs through projects, GitHub, or even LinkedIn visibility.</p>

    <p>Start by picking one track and learning end-to-end:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> HTML, CSS, JS → React → Node.js → MongoDB</li>
      <li><strong>App Development:</strong> Flutter or React Native</li>
      <li><strong>Backend Focused:</strong> Java + Spring Boot or Python + Django/FastAPI</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Build <strong>3–4 solid projects</strong> that you can showcase in your resume. Make sure they are hosted (e.g., on Render, Vercel, or GitHub Pages).</p>

    <h2>Step 4: Combine DSA + Dev (Best Option if Time Allows)</h2>
    <p>Doing both gives you an edge — most recruiters love candidates who can think logically and also build products. Here’s how you can balance it:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Morning: 2 hours of DSA</li>
      <li>Evening: 3–4 hours of project development</li>
      <li>Weekend: Resume building, mock interviews, and revision</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <strong>Tip:</strong> Spend 80% of your time doing — building, solving, implementing. Don’t get trapped watching tutorials all day.
    </div>

    <h2>Step 5: Market Yourself Properly</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Update your resume (1-page only). Highlight tech stack & projects.</li>
      <li>Post your learnings and projects on <strong>LinkedIn</strong>.</li>
      <li>Join coding groups, communities, and participate in <strong>hackathons</strong>.</li>
      <li>Take referrals — don’t hesitate to message people politely.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Even if you’re late, a focused 6–9 months plan can turn things around completely. Many students who started from zero in the final year have cracked FAANG-level companies — just by staying consistent.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
      <strong>Final Thought:</strong> Forget the past. You don’t need motivation — you need momentum. Start small, but start <em>today</em>.
